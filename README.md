###**My First Project**

#By Ken Rutan and Mohammed Warsi

###**Description**

This is a very basic webpage that is designed to demonstrate the very
early fundamentals of HTML, CSS and styling elements.  The theme of the
webpage is a half pit bull, half border collie dog that we are rather fond of.

###**Setup**

As an HTML file, this program should be self-executable, merely double clicking
on the icon should be enough to launch the website.

###**Technologies Used**

HTML

CSS
